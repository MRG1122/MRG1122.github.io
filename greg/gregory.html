        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there, I'm Michael Gregory, a senior at the University of Pittsburgh, majoring in Marketing with a double focus on Sports Management and Digital Media. Originally from the town of Farmington, Connecticut, my childhood was all about being outdoors and indulging in my love for sports.

As the years unfolded, my passion for sports grew, and I found myself excelling in both football and golf. I earned the titles of All-State and All-Conference football player and also played high school golf for 3 years. In high school, I also was a part of the journalism club and enjoyed writing articles for the school paper. 

Choosing Pitt was a no-brainer for me â€“ a perfect situation of my love for sports and the dream to pursue a career in the sports industry. The city's vibrant sports culture, coupled with major sports teams, provided the ideal backdrop for my academic and professional pursuits.

Looking ahead, I'm geared up to dive into the world of sports media post-graduation. The blend of Marketing, Sports Management, and Digital Media at Pitt has equipped me with the tools to thrive in this space. With a solid athletic background, a knack for storytelling, and a passion for all things sports, I'm excited about the journey ahead and the impact I can make in the realm of sports media.

        <h2>Check out my Job!</h2>
        <p>I currently work for the Pitt football team as a recruiting assistant. It has been an awesome experience and I have learned a lot about the business side of college football. In my role, I assist with scouting and evaluating high school athletes that Pitt is interested in. During the season, I get to stand on the sidelines for the games and entertain recruits who are invited to watch the games. I have also had the chance to meet some of the Steelers players, as they share a facility with the Pitt team. This job has been a really fun experience and one that I will always remember.

        <h2>Check out my hobbies!</h2>
        
        <p>Golf is another lifelong hobby of mine, and I have been playing since I was 6 years old. My grandpa would take me out golfing with him when I was very young and I was much more interested in looking at frogs in the pond than the actual golf! As I got older I began taking a liking to the game of golf and the challenging mental and physical aspects of the sport. This led me to join the high school golf team and I still enjoy playing to this day!
</p>

        <p>FISHING: This has been a lifelong passion of mine. As long as I can remember, I was always drawn to the thrill of fishing and being in the outdoors. During COVID, I developed a passion for a more niche style of fishing, fly fishing. Fly fishing can be very challenging but is also very rewarding. I learned to tie my own homemade flies and have grown my skills immensely in the last few years. </p>
